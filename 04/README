This Program generates a random map and places 11 total characters on it by default. The number of trainers can be changed with the '--numtrainers' switch. One being the player character, the map will also contain at least one hiker trainer and one rival trainer. The rest of the trainers are chosen at random and placed on the map. Once the program starts each character moves according to the rules laid out in the assignment spec. A new frame is generated every 25000 milliseconds and one character moves at a time.

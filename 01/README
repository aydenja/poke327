This program randomly generates the terrain for a pokemon inspired game. The map that it generates is 80x21 and it outputs the map to the terminal. The map contains 4 regions. 2 tall grass represented by ':', and 2 clearings represented by '.'. Clearings may also have rocks '%' and trees '^'. The map also contains two paths, one that runs N-S and one that runs E-W represented by '#'. Finally the map places two buildings, a pokecenter 'C' and pokemart 'M', along one of the paths.

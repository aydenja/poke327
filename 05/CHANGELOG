1/29: Started assignment, implemented borders, random generation of tall grass regions as well as clearings, tall grass regions are smaller than clearings but take priority over placement
1/30: Implemented the fill_path function and refactored code to fill_border and fill_grass in separate functions
1/31: Implemented path generation
2/1: Implemented optional terrain, trees, rocks. Implemented random placement of buildings along path.
2/4: Using instructors solution as a base for assignment 1.02, refactored code to allow choice exit placement instead of random placement. Implemented the get exits function that will get exit values from neighbor maps, if neighbor maps don't exist exits get assigned a random value.
2/5: Set up pointer array that represents the world. Initially, array is assigned to null. Implemented command system excluding fly.
2/6: Implemented showing coordinates along with printing map. Implemented fly command as well as error handing on invalid/out of bounds commands. 
2/7: Made exits on map edge unaccessible.
2/10: Started implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
2/11: continued implementing and debugging Dijkstra's algorithm.
2/12: Finished Dijkstra's algorithm and implemented printing distance maps.
2/24: Implemented placing chars on the map
2/25: Set up priority queue to drive char movement.
2/26: Implemented rules for movement for each char type.
2/27: Touching up algorithms for movement and updating move time in the priority queue.
3/16: Got the features of assignment 04 implemented using the curses library.
3/17: added pc movement and battle screens

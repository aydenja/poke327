This program builds upon the implementation of the previous assignments. Now when walking on tall grass, the player has a 1/10 chance of encountering a pokemon. Each pokemon is randomly selected from the csv data parsed in assignment 06. Stats, moves, and other characteristics of a pokemon are also generated randomly/based off the values from the csv files. Each characteristic is generated according to the assignment spec.

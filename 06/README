This program parses data from a csv file where the file name is given in the command line arguments when running the program. The program looks in three places for the csv file as documented in the assignment pdf.  The program uses the data in the csv files to construct the classes that represent that data. Once all the data is parsed, each class is printed to the terminal. Empty fields will not be printed. The program exits after the data is printed to the terminal, and the rest of the program does not run.

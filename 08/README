This program builds upon the implementation of the previous assignments. Battle systems have now been implemented. When the game starts the player has the choice to choose one of three randomly selected pokemon. After the player enters the game and encounters a trainer they will enter a battle submenu. Controls for the battle menu are the number keys 1, 2, 3, and 4. The battle works according to the pdf provided for this assignment. The player can also enter a battle with wild pokemon when walking in tall grass. If the player uses a pokeball on the wild pokemon and has enough room in their inventory they will catch the pokemon. The player also now has access to the bag. Then can access the bag during a battle or while traversing the map. When outside the battle the bag can be accessed using the capital 'B' key. The player is given twenty of each item to begin with as a placeholder for now. 
Cheats: Other than the cheats implemented by the instructor the player can hit 'q' during a battle to automatically win the battle/catch the pokemon.
